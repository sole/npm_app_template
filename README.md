# npm_app_template

> a template for building an app using npm modules + browserify + gulp

## getting it

### clone it

`git clone https://github.com/sole/npm_app_template.git`

### or download

[the zip](https://github.com/sole/npm_app_template/archive/master.zip)

## initialising

Install node.js if not installed yet, then cd to the directory and run `npm init`.

To build the files into the `build` folder just do `npm start`. This will start a gulp script and it will watch for changes in the src folder and rebuild. Open `build/index.html` to see your thing in action, or better yet serve it with a local server.

Now GO and create amazing stuff.
